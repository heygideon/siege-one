# Meeple Clicker

It's like Cookie Clicker, but I made it for Hack Club Siege.

**Week 1 theme:** Coins

- Click to earn coins, easy
- Add upgrades to earn more coins per click, or earn coins passively
- Spend your coins to decorate your little meeple stick man
- Download your finished meeple (if you want to!)

## Development

This is my first time using Vue in a while üòÖ With that said, if you want to try this on your computer:

```sh
pnpm install
# and then:
pnpm dev
```

## Inspiration

I just wanted to make something fun, that's all :)
